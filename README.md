# myResume

This is my first repo on GitHub and I hope not the last one.
This is a fork from [afnizarnur](https://github.com/afnizarnur)'s great work.

## Why?

The main idea was to learn how to use GitHub properly, use my own repo, push and pull.
I always wanted to create my own website, so creating an online resume seemed to be a create idea to start using GitHub.

## How?

As said above, I forked [afnizarnur's draco repo](https://github.com/afnizarnur/draco).
As I am still fairly new to all of this, I decided to use [Codeny](http://codenvy.io). I think it is a great tool, wherever I am, I can work on this website.

## What's the plan?

My goal is to run this on my RaspberryPi. But I am quite concerned on security issues and what would be the best way to do so.
